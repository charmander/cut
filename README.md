Cut is half of a cropping interface in browser JavaScript. It provides support
for dragging and scaling an image relative to a fixed cropping box.

`demo/` contains an example of a cropping tool with close-to-global support
via Cut, `<input type="image">`, and another set of `<input>` elements, which
receive (and display) specific coordinates. Feel free to use it as a base.

Cut supports Internet Explorer 9 and higher, and the most recent stable
version of anything else.
